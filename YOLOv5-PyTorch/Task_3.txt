Proposal Report

(a) Write a Proposal on what is multi label dataset and how the problem can be solved.

A multi-label dataset contains images where multiple objects may appear simultaneously, potentially of different classes. 
Each object is annotated in the ground truth with its class and bounding box coordinates. 
Object detection models like YOLO can handle multi-label datasets by learning to predict all present objects in an image, 
producing multiple bounding boxes and class predictions.

(b) what changes should be made in groundtruth.

For a multi-label dataset, the ground truth must annotate every object in the image. Each object should have its class ID and bounding box coordinates.
This allows the model to learn to detect multiple objects per image.


(c) What updates are mandatory in any model architecture to support multi-label dataset training.

For classification: Sigmoid, no softmax as softmax is use for single label. Also, BCE for classification loss per class object is applied.
BCE loss for objectness score loss - yes/no
ciou/giou/eiou - bbox loss regression
